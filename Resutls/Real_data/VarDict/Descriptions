The directory contains the VarDict predicted variants results of real data NA12878. The summary csv is the results of hap.py.

The original resutls is one VCF files contains both SNVs and Indels.
But Github only allow max 25MB file to upload, so I had to split VarDict original resutls to SNVs and Indels
